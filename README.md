* Machine Learning Fuel Consumption (https://github.com/Andre-Seiji/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Fuel%20Consumption/Decision_Tree_Fuel_Consumption_example.ipynb): a decision tree model to predict fuel consumption of vehicles. **The model has 92% accuracy and correctly predicts a car that is not on the dataset.**  
* Machine Learning Diabetes (https://github.com/Andre-Seiji/Data-Science-Portfolio/blob/main/Machine%20Learning%20Diabetes/Naive_bayes_Diabetes.ipynb): a naive bayes model that classifies diabetes of a small and unbalanced database.
